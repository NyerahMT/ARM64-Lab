## Publisher standalone target audit

MX Bikes has a publisher-sold standalone Windows edition. That is a possible
**legitimate** route for removing a *Steam-client dependency* from the port,
but it is neither automatically licensed by a Steam purchase nor a native iOS
build. We must inspect the actual owned standalone executable first.

From the public repository root on your own computer, with the original
standalone executable **outside the checkout**:

```sh
python mxbikes-ios/scripts/mxbikes_standalone_import_audit.py \
  --standalone-exe /path/to/publisher-licensed/standalone/mxbikes.exe \
  --out /tmp/mxb-standalone-audit
```

The output `standalone-candidate-imports.json` includes an independent SHA,
entry point, exception record count, and Steam/graphics/Windows import
inventory. It does not copy the EXE, assets, original code, keys, or game
memory. It never executes the candidate.

A report with zero `steam_symbol_count` only means **no static imported
Steam API symbols were found**. It does *not* prove that the original program
will initialize without Steam, that its licensing is valid, or that it has
a functioning engine/renderer. A new SHA needs its own original-code trace,
CFG map, and independent native ARM64 validation: the Steam EXE's pinned RVAs
must NOT be reused as if they were the standalone layout.

See [authenticated original game execution](run-original-locally.md) for
the *Steam* target. Those tests still stop at the unsupported Steam API.
